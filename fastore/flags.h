// Set this flag to use AES as the underlying PRF (rather than HMAC) for the
// basic ORE construction (ore). Currently, we only support encrypting 64-bit
// values when AES is the underlying PRF. The HMAC implementation supports
// encrypting messages from an arbitrary plaintext space.
#define USE_AES

// Set this flag to use AES to instantiate the random oracle in the block ORE
// (ore_blk) construction. This construction can be proven secure if we, for
// instance, model AES as an ideal cipher (see Section 7 of the paper for a
// full discussion: http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/612.pdf). If this flag is
// turned off, then the random oracle is instantiated using SHA-256.
